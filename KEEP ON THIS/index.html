          <h3>Honesty</h3>
          <p>Alethea has been wanting to create an honest and clean handwash that is safe for her and her family
            to use without the worry of harmful chemicals and fragrances. Using a simple and clean script typeface
            for the wordmark, it represents the simple and clean ingredients that go into making her products. A
            little water droplet implemented into the swash of the H represents the purpose of her products.

          <h3>Ginger's Pantry</h3>
          <p>Ginger and her family have opened up a business called Ginger's Pantry. This idea was brought up during 2020 when
            the stores no longer had much fresh produce to choose from. Ginger's Pantry offers home delivery for completely fresh
            groceries/produce straight to your door. Her hopes are to bring more freshness into peoples homes without the fuss of shopping!

          <h3>Melchor Lullaby Hotline</h3>
          <p>A vinyl album cover designed for Adam Melchor’s “Melchor Lullaby Hotline Vol. 1”. Using literal terminology to determine front
            cover illustrates image of Melchor with a pillow and sleep gown, sleeping in a bed next to a landline phone. Using lyrics from the
            tracklist, the back cover shows illustrations of elements within each song.</p>

            <h3>Men vs. Women</h3>
            <p>57% of bachelor degrees were earned by women in 2013. This infographic poster shows the relation between men and women
              graduating and factual information that ties in with it. Two kinds of charts were used to display a fact visually, and I used
              simple icons to show the physical element mentioned within other facts. As follows, using a simple off white background allowed
              the pink for women and blue for men to pop out and be cohesive.</p>

              <h3>World's Longest Bubble</h3>
              <p>Alan McKay of Wellington, New Zealand created a bubble 105 feet long on August 9, 1996. He made it using a bubble wand,
                dish washing liquid, glycerine and water. This poster was created with a bubble effect created by multiple layers of bevel
                and embossing texture. Illustrated on Procreate, there is a bubble wand at the bottom that appears to be blowing the bubble
                of text. Blurred in multiple strengths, bubbles are around the space to give a sense of depth.</p>
